"""
__Mask__

We define the ‘real_space_mask’ which defines the grid the image the strong lens is evaluated using.

Basiclaly, the lens model is evaluated in real space and then mapped to Fourier Space via the NUFFT. This
matrix therefore defines the dimensions of certain matrices which enter our likelihood function and calculation.
"""
real_space_mask = al.Mask2D.circular(
    shape_native=(100, 100),
    pixel_scales=0.2,
    radius=3.0,
)


"""
__Interferometer Dataset__

We load an example interferometer dataset which will be used to help us develop the likelihood function.
"""
dataset_type = "sma"

dataset_path = path.join("dataset", dataset_type)

dataset = al.Interferometer.from_fits(
    data_path=path.join(dataset_path, "data.fits"),
    noise_map_path=path.join(dataset_path, "noise_map.fits"),
    uv_wavelengths_path=path.join(dataset_path, "uv_wavelengths.fits"),
    real_space_mask=real_space_mask,
    transformer_class=al.TransformerDFT,
)

"""
__Mapping__

The code below does not need to run in JAX, and is used to create a `mapping_matrix` which is the starting
point for the interferometer code we currently seek to JAX-ify.
