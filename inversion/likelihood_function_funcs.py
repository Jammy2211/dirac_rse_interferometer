    Returns the curvature matrix `F` (see Warren & Dye 2003) from `w_tilde`.

    The dimensions of `w_tilde` are [image_pixels, image_pixels], meaning that for datasets with many image pixels
    this matrix can take up 10's of GB of memory. The calculation of the `curvature_matrix` via this function will
    therefore be very slow, and the method `curvature_matrix_via_w_tilde_curvature_preload_imaging_from` should be used
    instead.

    Parameters
    ----------
    w_tilde
        A matrix of dimensions [image_pixels, image_pixels] that encodes the convolution or NUFFT of every image pixel
        pair on the noise map.
    mapping_matrix
        The matrix representing the mappings between sub-grid pixels and pixelization pixels.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The curvature matrix `F` (see Warren & Dye 2003).

    From the pixel-neighbors array, setup the regularization matrix using the instance regularization scheme.

    A complete description of regularizatin and the `regularization_matrix` can be found in the `Regularization`
    class in the module `autoarray.inversion.regularization`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coefficient
        The regularization coefficients which controls the degree of smoothing of the inversion reconstruction.
    neighbors
        An array of length (total_pixels) which provides the index of all neighbors of every pixel in
        the Voronoi grid (entries of -1 correspond to no neighbor).
    neighbors_sizes
        An array of length (total_pixels) which gives the number of neighbors of every pixel in the
        Voronoi grid.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        The regularization matrix computed using Regularization where the effective regularization
        coefficient of every source pixel is the same.

def reconstruction_positive_negative_from(

    """
    Solve the linear system [F + reg_coeff*H] S = D -> S = [F + reg_coeff*H]^-1 D given by equation (12)
    of https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0302587.pdf

    S is the vector of reconstructed inversion values.

    This reconstruction uses a linear algebra solver that allows for negative and positives values in the solution.
    By allowing negative values, the solver is efficient, but there are many inference problems where negative values
    are nonphysical or undesirable.

    This function checks that the solution does not give a linear algebra error (e.g. because the input matrix is
    not positive-definitive).

    It also explicitly checks solutions where all reconstructed values go to the same value, and raises an exception if
    this occurs. This solution occurs in many scenarios when it is clear not a valid solution, and therefore is checked
    for and removed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data_vector
        The `data_vector` D which is solved for.
    curvature_reg_matrix
        The sum of the curvature and regularization matrices.
    mapper_param_range_list
        A list of lists, where each list contains the range of values in the solution vector (reconstruction) that
        correspond to values that are part of a mapper's mesh.
    force_check_reconstruction
        If `True`, the reconstruction is forced to check for solutions where all reconstructed values go to the same
        value irrespective of the configuration file value.

    Returns
    -------
    curvature_reg_matrix
        The curvature_matrix plus regularization matrix, overwriting the curvature_matrix in memory.
