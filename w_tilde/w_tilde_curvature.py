def w_tilde_curvature_interferometer_from(

    """
    The matrix w_tilde is a matrix of dimensions [image_pixels, image_pixels] that encodes the NUFFT of every pair of
    image pixels given the noise map. This can be used to efficiently compute the curvature matrix via the mappings
    between image and source pixels, in a way that omits having to perform the NUFFT on every individual source pixel.
    This provides a significant speed up for inversions of interferometer datasets with large number of visibilities.

    The limitation of this matrix is that the dimensions of [image_pixels, image_pixels] can exceed many 10s of GB's,
    making it impossible to store in memory and its use in linear algebra calculations extremely. The method
    `w_tilde_preload_interferometer_from` describes a compressed representation that overcomes this hurdles. It is
    advised `w_tilde` and this method are only used for testing.

    grid_radians_slim : ndarray, shape (M, 2), dtype=float64
        The 1D (y,x) grid of coordinates in radians corresponding to real-space mask within which the image that is
        Fourier transformed is computed.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray : ndarray, shape (M, M), dtype=float64

"""
__Example__

We now load an interferometer dataset and input the quantities which use the funciton above to make
the w tilde matrix.

__Mask__

We define the ‘real_space_mask’ which defines the grid the image the strong lens is evaluated using.

Basiclaly, the lens model is evaluated in real space and then mapped to Fourier Space via the NUFFT. This
matrix therefore defines the dimensions of certain matrices which enter our likelihood function and calculation.

__Interferometer Dataset__

We load an example interferometer dataset which will be used to help us develop the likelihood function.

"""
__W Tilde__

The code below calls the w_tilde function above to create the w_tilde matrix, which we need to speed up via JAX.

Note that we have to put `np.array()` in front of all objects.

This is because of what we discussed in the telecom, where JAX arrays are typed (e.g. `Array2D`) and need special
behaviour to ensure JAX worked on the JAX'ed array. This is what `np.array()` achieves.

The source code now requires these `np.array()`'s to be in place even though we're currenlty using numba.
